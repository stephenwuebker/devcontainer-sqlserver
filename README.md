# devcontainer-sqlserver

This is currently broken as far as I'm concerned, because I develop on an ARM-based Mac.

The current official SQL Server docker containers only support x64-based platforms. Once Microsoft updates those containers to be multi-platform and support ARM, I'll continue updating this repo. As of now, this is mearly a placeholder.

To use/install, add this repository as a git submodule like:

```git submodule add https://github.com/stephenwuebker/devcontainer-sqlserver .devcontainer```
